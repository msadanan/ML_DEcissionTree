* preferred configuration: python 2.7.x with annaconda and nltk libraries
                           By default, the application assumes that the test and training datasets are present in the same directory as the python script
                           The file path can be adjusted in the loadFile function call.
* Dependencies: DataSets should be in the file path "./DataSet/AmazonReviews/" for amazon reviews and "./DataSet/DigitRecognition/" for optical recognision
* Database configuration: not necessary
* How to run tests: python <filename>   (amazonAnalysis.py or opticalRecogniser.py)

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines: It is preferred to run the scripts on High Performance Clusters if the data set is huge.
